OpenGL = software interface to graphics hardware (~150 distinct commands)
  > Streamlined, hardware-independent interface
  > Therefore, no commands for performing windowing tasks or user input included in OpenGL so work through windowing system that using
  > Doesn't provide high-level commands for 3D objects; instead, must build up desired model from a small set of geometric primitives (points, lines. and polygons)
GLU (OpenGL Utility Library) = provides many modeling features, e.g. quadric surfaces & NURBS curves and surfaces
  > Standard part of every OpenGL implementation
Open Inventor = higher-level, object-oriented toolkit, built atop OpenGL & available separately
